This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)‚Äù.

1\. TO DO: how are we ensuring that the organizers identify themselves as contact points for the code of conduct, and how are we ensuring that they have been trained to handle incidents?

2\. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a organizing team member. All reports
are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have
had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection
as it is the other attendees.

When reporting the event to organizers, try to gather as much information as available but do not
interview people about the incident. Organizers will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information of the participant doing the harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

The organizers are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

3\. If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request.
If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by
dialing 911. If you do not have a cell phone, simply ask any organizer.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they
will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for
the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. RailsBridge organizers requests
that they be your first resource when reporting a RailsBridge-related incident, so that they may enforce
the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution.

TO DO: Contact information?
