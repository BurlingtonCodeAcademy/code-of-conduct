RailsBridge Code of Conduct
=====================

This is a code of conduct for RailsBridge workshops. It is a fork of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct.

Each workshop's organizers are responsible for ensuring that this code of conduct is:

* Visible to all attendees and volunteers prior to the workshop and
* Discussed with everyone at the opening presentation

## To Do

*Adopting a Code of Conduct*

* Adopt Code of Conduct as a community
 * Figure out what that means, really. A committee? The board?
* Figure out our process for updating the Code of Conduct moving forward

*Adding the Code of Conduct to our materials*

* Add Code of Conduct + incident guides to RailsBridge.org
* Add Code of Conduct info to teacher training slides
* Add Code of Conduct info to any and all opening presentation decks

*Advertising the Code of Conduct*

* Write a blog post introducing the Code of Conduct
* Train all meta-organizers on training organizers on why it's important

## Things To Discuss

* Do we want everyone to sign a piece of paper with their agreement to abide by the Code of Conduct?
 * This could be done once per participant & stored as a boolean in Bridge Troll
* Do we want to clarify that any workshop that calls itself a RailsBridge needs to:
 * Agree to this Code of Conduct
 * Enforce this Code of Conduct
 * Anything else?
