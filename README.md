RailsBridge Code of Conduct
=====================

This is a code of conduct for RailsBridge workshops. It is a fork of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct.

Each workshop's organizers are responsible for ensuring that this code of conduct is:

* Visible to all attendees and volunteers prior to the workshop and
* Discussed with everyone at the opening presentation
