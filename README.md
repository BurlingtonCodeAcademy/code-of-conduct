RailsBridge Code of Conduct
=====================

This is the code of conduct for RailsBridge workshops. It is a fork of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct.

Each workshop's organizers are responsible for ensuring that this code of conduct is:

* Visible to all attendees and volunteers prior to the workshop and
* Discussed with everyone at the opening presentation


## To Do

**Adopting a code of conduct**

* Figure out our process for updating the code of conduct moving forward

**Adding the code of conduct to our materials**

* Add code of conduct + incident guides to RailsBridge.org
* Add code of conduct info to teacher training slides
* Add code of conduct info to any and all opening presentation decks

**Advertising the code of conduct**

* Write a blog post introducing the code of conduct
* Train all meta-organizers on training organizers on why it's important

## Things To Discuss

* Do we want everyone to sign a piece of paper with their agreement to abide by the code of conduct?
 * This could be done once per participant & stored as a boolean in Bridge Troll
* Do we want to clarify that any workshop that calls itself a RailsBridge needs to:
 * Agree to this code of conduct
 * Enforce this code of conduct
 * Anything else?
* The PyCon code of conduct was written for a very large event. The language should probably be updated to be more appropriate / senstitive to the size of a RailsBridge worskhop / event.
